The Placement Management System is developed using PHP to help colleges manage student placements efficiently. It allows administrators to store and manage student details, company information, and placement records. Students can register, update their profiles, and view placement opportunities. Companies can post job openings and shortlist candidates. This system makes the placement process faster, more organized, and paperless, making it easier for both students and placement officers to track and manage activities.
